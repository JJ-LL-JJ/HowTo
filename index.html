        <div class=story>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a lady who’s name was Bolady who had a dog named BoLily. She had a pet dog named BoLily. One day she did not have a job, but she wanted a job and she was looking for a job, but at the time she didn’t have a job. Her husband was in college and he had a job, but he wasn’t working that day so they had nothing to do that day so when they got an invitation to a wedding they were like “Something to do!” and they didn’t even know that they would become good friends with the people who were getting married. The people getting married were named Bomurderer and Bowife.</p>
            <p>Bolady who had a dog named Bolily would never forget the day she had gotten Bolily. She and her husband had been wanting a dog all day, ever since Bograce had gotten one the day before. Finally they went to the animal shelter because they wanted a dog. The first dog they looked at ran around in circles for a little bit and then went to sleep.</p>
            <p>“That’s for me!” Bolady’s husband said, but Bolady said, “Uh-uh!”</p>
            <p>“I don’t like docile dogs,” she explained to the animal shelter guy. “I want a dog that has energy so it can take walks with me but can also take a nap when I take a nap because sometimes I don’t feel very well and have to lie down and take a nap and I want a dog that will take that nap with me but I don’t want a dog that will nap all the time I want a dog with energy and only takes naps when I takes naps and—”</p>
            <p>In the end Bolady went home with Bolily, and everyone else went home with a migraine. Since there was only one migraine they cut it up and each took a piece.</p>
            <p>“Delicious,” said Bolady’s husband.</p>
            <p>One day Bolady and Bowife went to church. They were in the nursery playing with the toys when some kids came in and started playing.</p>
            <p>Bolady turned to them and said “Are you babies?” in a voice she thought made her sound clever.</p>
            <p>The kids thought for a moment then shook their heads. Bolady waved her hand in the direction of the door to indicate that they were supposed to leave. The kids paused, then ran as fast they could to get away from the scary lady.</p>
            <p>“That’s what happens when kids have helicopter parents.” Bolady said</p>
            <p>Bolady’s husband had 3 friends whose names were BoChris Pratt, Bomurderer, and BoBoBopoethehuttsickmetrius, or BoBoBometrius for short. Bomurderer was the groom at the wedding when Bolady and her husband didn’t even know that they would become good friends with the people getting married. BoBoBometrius had just gotten married.</p>
            <p>One day while Bolady’s husband was working at Bomart, where he worked, BoBoBometrius came to him and invited him to his wedding reception.</p>
            <p>“I guess now my name is BoBoBomarriedmetrius.” BoBoBometrius said.</p>
            <p>Bolady’s husband had worked at Bomart for a long time but he was probably going to be fired soon. That’s because he had trouble holding things. Whenever he held something he either gripped it so hard that it broke or else he would hold it really lightly because he was afraid he would break it and then he would drop it so he couldn’t even hold things ever.</p>
            <p>When BoLady and her husband arrived at the wedding reception, which was being held at BoBoBometrius’s parent’s house, the first thing they noticed was how crowded it was. Bolady didn’t mind crowds, she knew she could talk over them.</p>
            <p>The second thing they noticed was BoBoBometrius’ father’s grumpy face. Bolady noted that he was not Santa Claus.</p>
            <p>The third thing they noticed was the group of really cool groups of kids standing there in a group like a group of really cool kids grouped together. This was the street gang, the dangerous gang, THE gang, the Bobags.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing they noticed was the smallest of the Bobags walking around with BoBoBometrius’ niece, locked in an epic embrace. The small Bobag’s was named Boly. The niece's name was Bolivia.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing they noticed was the impenetrable wall of armed guards surrounding the food table. Bolady headed straight towards them. The guards separated to let her pass.</p>
            <p>After Bolady had filled her plate to the brim, she walked to the couch. Bolady sat right down next to BoBoBometrius’ wife, Bohan. Bohan was a Bobag before she got married and is a Bobag to this day. Bolady talked to poor Bohan for a long time while she was eating.</p>
            <p>“I just love parties,” she said. “Normally at parties everyone else watches tv, but Bolday’s husband, BoBoBometrius and I go in the kitchen and talk about theology.”</p>
            <p>“I’m very glad you told me that,” Bohan said.</p>
            <p>Once Bolady’s plate was empty she went to get more food. When she returned one of the Bobags was sitting in her seat. That made her angry. She sat somewhere else and glared at the girl who stole her seat. The girl’s name was Brosie.</p>
            <p>Bolady’s sister in-law was an old lady who was nineteen and old. She hated Brosie because Brosie was nineteen and young. “Ah, I hate you,” she said.</p>
            <p>A different Bobag passed by the guards. “Where’s your coat$” one of the guards asked, causing the rest to laugh. The Bobag walked away looking really scared because he was really scared. His name was Banjo.</p>
            <p>Brosie whispered in Banjo’s ear, “Bolady must be 36 because she’s old and ugly.”</p>
            <p>Banjo whispered back, “But that other lady is also old and ugly and she’s just nineteen.”</p>
            <p>“Ah, I hate you,” said the ugly nineteen year-old.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in the basement, there were a bunch of scary teengers watching a baby show and sleeping on each other's shoulders.</p>
            <p>Bowife came and sat next to Bolady. Bolady started talking.</p>
            <p>“I don’t like plain grilled cheese sandwiches,” she said. “I only like them with ham, or something on them.”</p>
            <p>Boly walked by, still in an epic embrace with Bolivia.</p>
            <p>One of the Bobags finally got through the wall of guards and got two crackers. “That’s a lot of food, pig,” one of the guards said. Now the Bobag was crying because the guards were mean to him. Poor little boy. He was only seven and he just wanted a few crackers. His name was Boju.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Bobags were named Bobean, Borebec, and Bollie. There was another Bobag who wasn’t at the party. Her name was Bonan and she was hiding in Ireland because she was a coward.</p>
            <p>There were a bunch of old ladies at the party who would not stop asking Banjo how tall he was.</p>
            <p>Bomurderer, BoChris Pratt, and Bolady’s husband went outside to reenact Lord of the Rings. “The fellowship,” Bolady said in what she thought was a cool voice.</p>
            <p>There was a jar for people to write down ideas of what BoBoBometrius and Bohan should do on their dates. Banjo wrote that they should take him and the rest of the Bobags to a Chinese buffet, but they didn’t.</p>
            <p>Bolady looked up from her food and saw BoBoBometrius and Bohan hugging. “You two are just the cutest couple,” she said.</p>
            <p>There was a short scary bald Russian lady with blond hair. Her name was Boring Borussian from Ukraine. She blew Bohan a kiss and Bohan had to wash her face to get it off.</p>
            <p>Bohan couldn’t eat the cake, but she still had to take an awkward picture with it.</p>
            <p>The party lasted for forty days and forty nights, and Bolady stayed the whole time. Even when the party was over she was still there. When she finally left there were still scary teenagers in the basement sleeping on each other's shoulders.</p>
